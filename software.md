# Software developed in the Scientific Computing Group


## Neural networks for ODEs (including closure modeling for turbulent flows)
- [NeuralClosureTutorials](https://github.com/agdestein/NeuralClosureTutorials): Neural closure modeling tutorials from the 2023 SciML semester programme.
- [IncompressibleNavierStokes.jl](https://agdestein.github.io/IncompressibleNavierStokes.jl/dev/): Incompressible Navier-Stokes solver in Julia with neural networks to model turbulence.
- [DEEPDIP project](https://github.com/DEEPDIP-project): Project to integrate neural networks in physics applications through SciML libraries. In particular, the [CNODE](https://github.com/DEEPDIP-project/CoupledNODE.jl) is a coupling library in which multiple coupled ODEs with neural networks in the right-hand side can be learned from data.
